This shall help in converting the group Recipients of an email you get from an organisation into List of recipients mail ids..

For example:
  There is a college Faculty who sends all its students a mail.. 
  We want that list of mail id!!
  We can do this by copying the recipients List from Mail we get and copying it in mail.txt
  But its in format HARSH AGARWAL <agarwal.harshnu@gmail.com>, OTHER NAME <other_mail_id@gmail.com>
  Hence this can be converted to agarwal.harshnu@gmail.com other_mail_id@gmail.com and saved int mail2.txt
  Now this mail2.txt will have all mail id List
